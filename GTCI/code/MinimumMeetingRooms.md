# Minimum Meeting Rooms (hard)

## problem statement

Given a list of intervals representing the start and end time of ‘N’ meetings, find the minimum number of rooms required to hold all the meetings.

Example 1:

```java
Meetings: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we need two rooms to hold these two meetings. [7,9] can
occur in any of the two rooms later.
```

Example 2:

```java
Meetings: [[6,7], [2,4], [8,12]]
Output: 1
Explanation: None of the meetings overlap, therefore we only need one room to hold all meetings.
```

Example 3:

```java
Meetings: [[1,4], [2,3], [3,6]]
Output:2
Explanation: Since [1,4] overlaps with the other two meetings [2,3] and [3,6], we need two rooms to
hold all the meetings.
```

Example 4:

```java
Meetings: [[4,5], [2,3], [2,4], [3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We will need one room for [2,3] and [3,5], and another room for [2,4] and [4,5].
```

## my solution (wrong)

```java
import java.util.*;

class Meeting {
  int start;
  int end;

  public Meeting(int start, int end) {
    this.start = start;
    this.end = end;
  }
};

class MinimumMeetingRooms {

  public static int findMinimumMeetingRooms(List<Meeting> meetings) {
    // 1. sort the meetings
    // 2. track rooms = 0
    // 3. if overlap, rooms += 1, maxRooms = Math.max(rooms, maxRooms)
    // 4. if not overlap, rooms = 0;
    Collections.sort(meetings, (a, b) -> a.start - b.start);

    int rooms = 0;
    int maxRooms = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < meetings.size(); i++) {
      Meeting prev = meetings.get(i - 1);
      Meeting curr = meetings.get(i);
      if (curr.start <= prev.end && prev.end <= curr.end) {
        rooms += 1;
        maxRooms = Math.max(rooms, maxRooms);
      } else {
        rooms = 0;
      }
    }

    return maxRooms;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<Meeting> input = new ArrayList<Meeting>() {
      {
        add(new Meeting(4, 5));
        add(new Meeting(2, 3));
        add(new Meeting(2, 4));
        add(new Meeting(3, 5));
      }
    };
    int result = MinimumMeetingRooms.findMinimumMeetingRooms(input);
    System.out.println("Minimum meeting rooms required: " + result);

    input = new ArrayList<Meeting>() {
      {
        add(new Meeting(1, 4));
        add(new Meeting(2, 5));
        add(new Meeting(7, 9));
      }
    };
    result = MinimumMeetingRooms.findMinimumMeetingRooms(input);
    System.out.println("Minimum meeting rooms required: " + result);

    input = new ArrayList<Meeting>() {
      {
        add(new Meeting(6, 7));
        add(new Meeting(2, 4));
        add(new Meeting(8, 12));
      }
    };
    result = MinimumMeetingRooms.findMinimumMeetingRooms(input);
    System.out.println("Minimum meeting rooms required: " + result);

    input = new ArrayList<Meeting>() {
      {
        add(new Meeting(1, 4));
        add(new Meeting(2, 3));
        add(new Meeting(3, 6));
      }
    };
    result = MinimumMeetingRooms.findMinimumMeetingRooms(input);
    System.out.println("Minimum meeting rooms required: " + result);

    input = new ArrayList<Meeting>() {
      {
        add(new Meeting(4, 5));
        add(new Meeting(2, 3));
        add(new Meeting(2, 4));
        add(new Meeting(3, 5));
      }
    };
    result = MinimumMeetingRooms.findMinimumMeetingRooms(input);
    System.out.println("Minimum meeting rooms required: " + result);
  }
}
```
